    title: What is MMIC?
    content: >-
      The Molecular Mechanics Interoperable Components (MMIC) project provides a
      standard for input and output of MM programs by defining the scientific
      and computational stages of classical MM pipelines, but leaving the
      implementation up to the developer/user. MMIC attempts to define the
      “what” of scientific stages without restricting the “how” i.e. MMIC
      defines only the input and output the implementation must conform to so
      that end-users can swap out different implementations with minimal effort
      in their existing pipelines, or workflow tools of their preference. The
      components themselves allow users to speed up most of their pipelines by
      integrating the expertise from component developers, letting them focus on
      the parts of their research they are experts in.


      This allows reproducibility from statically defined and shareable
      components, experimentation to find a quality series of components for
      specific problems and systems, and a mechanism for quality methodological
      assessment without the need for deep scientific expertise.
