    title: What is MMIC?
    content: >-
      The Molecular Mechanics Interoperable Components (MMIC) project provides a
      standard for input and output of MM programs by defining the scientific
      and computational stages of classical MM pipelines, but leaving the
      implementation up to the developer/user. MMIC attempts to define the
      “what” of scientific stages without restricting the “how” i.e. MMIC
      defines only the input and output the implementation must conform to so
      that end-users can swap out different implementations with minimal effort
      in their existing pipelines, or workflow tools of their choice.
